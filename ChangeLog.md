# Race into Space changes

## Version 2.0

### BACK-END CHANGES

- Game brought over from Sourceforge to GitHub
- Versioning system converted from CVS to GIT
- Code converted from C to C++
- Code cleanup to make the game easier to modify (#623, #626, #639, #644, $645, among others)
- Parts of the code brought into line with standards (#624)
- Many of the data files and images have been changed to use discrete image files rather than being embedded into the code (#51)
- Vestigial copy protection code finally removed (#493)
- We've added some JSON serialization for game data and save games. (#478)
- The abbreviation for the sound to play in the Intelligence screens was "INTELLEG" - now "INTELLIG"
- In the config file, "altasLunar" has been corrected to "atlasLunar"

Since transitioning to C++ on GIT, the game has been brought up to where we left off
 (that is, bugs introduced by the transition have been fixed).
Below are improvements that have been made over what the game offered in v.1.1.

### BUG FIXES AND PROBLEMS SOLVED

- The duration penalty system has been fixed, and is working right for the first time ever (#246)
   - This makes a final solution to what has sometimes been called the "Duration B Bug"
- The newscast that announces all manned missions will be canceled this turn no longer cancels unmanned 
  missions as well (#164)
- 'Nauts killed in a newscast (train accident, etc.) are now removed immediately (#240)
   - Before, they wouldn't be removed until the start of the following turn, making it possible for 
     the dead crew member to fly on a mission<br/>
- If you flew a Docking Duration mission and the Docking step failed, it would cancel the remainder 
  of the mission without attempting Duration (#322)<br/>
- If you fly a Lunar Orbital LM Test and the LM Test part fails, the game didn't give you credit for 
  having flown the Lunar Orbital, even though the lunar orbital part was successful. (#332)<br/><br/>
- On a mission where the rocket explodes but the crew escapes thanks to the Launch Escape System pulling 
  the capsule to safety, you still got credit for Manned Space Mission.  Now you won't get credit for 
  that unless the mission hits the Reentry step. (#330)<br/>
- The newscast announcing that a storm front has blocked a launch window now specifies which pad (#169)
   - Before, it had called it "the H launch facility" (since h is used as a variable).
- When a component faces a Safety penalty unless the player pays to fix it, there was sometimes a 
  mismatch between newscast and actual numbers (#204, #243)<br/>
- The VAB/VIB wasn't properly reporting damage to rockets (where you're required to pay xMB 
  or suffer y% Safety loss on its next mission).<br/>
- When a component faces a Safety penalty unless the player pays to fix it, it didn't make sure you had 
  enough cash to pay, allowing you to have a negative number of MBs (#268) [not sure if this was in 1.1]<br/>
- The second of the two newscasts announcing that the primary crew caught cold and will be replaced 
  with the backup crew never worked before; now it does (#286, #325)<br/>
- The newscast stating that an astronaut left to become a test pilot or has been transferred for 
  reeducation instead sent them to the hospital/infirmary (#290)<br/>
- The newscast saying a given piece of hardware has lost x% Safety could sometimes claim it lost more 
  than it actually had (#569)
- The LM failure "Engine explodes upon ignition. Spacecraft crew is killed." used to kill all three 
  crew members instead of just the Commander and LM Pilot (#476)<br/>
- If the LM lifts off from the Moon but fails to develop full thrust and makes an emergency landing 
  back on the surface, stranding the crew, the Docking Specialist up in orbit died too (but managed to 
  bring the capsule home anyway) (#287)<br/>
- On a lunar landing, "Permanent communications loss with ground control. Mission is scrubbed." would 
  ask who should be first on the Moon, but it shouldn't have because no one was getting out. (#514)<br/>
- Because of the nature of the variable for 'naut mood, after a successful mission it could roll over
  above 100, which would result in a very low number, potentially leading to two entire flight 
  crews resigning out of sudden bitterness during their moment of triumph (#484)<br/>
- The newscast that delayed a mission on the pad used to delay missions that couldn't have been 
  put back a turn (such as Mars/Jupiter/Saturn flybys).<br/>
- There were three newscasts which were supposed to reduce your budget by 20, 25, or 30 MBs, or by 
  20%, 25%, or 30% of your budget, whichever is less.  Instead, if 20/25/30% was less than 20/25/30 MB,
  it reduced your budget *****to***** 20/25/30% of what it had been, causing your budget to drop like a rock.
  (#394)<br/>
- There was also a newscast that was supposed to increase your budget by 20MB, but the conditions under 
  which it was allowed effectively prevented it ever happening (#397)<br/>
- When a newscast gives you three Air Force pilots, they now come with skills. They used to start out in 
  Basic Training with 0s in everything (#541) <br/>
- In the Capsule Screen, if you tried to break an empty crew, it would tell you the crew was assigned 
  as the backup crew for a current mission - now it says it's an empty crew (#348)<br/>
- Jupiter flybys were set to take 7 turns to arrive, the same as Saturn - now they're set to 4 like
  they were supposed to be (#171)
- Removed visual artifacts next to astronaut wings and medals in Astronaut/Cosmonaut History 
  (#299, from #192)<br/>
- Better centering of astronaut wings in Astro/Cosmonaut history for those who've flown in space.<br/>
- Fixed a bug with technology transfer for the Titan/Proton rocket: the technology bonus from multiple 
  rockets at 75%+ was not being applied (#310)<br/>
- Fixed a bug in Future Missions: if you chose a mission and proceeded to where you select a capsule 
  or crew, then cancel - then press Continue again (either after choosing a different mission or 
  deciding to go ahead with the same one), and you select capsule or crew, when you go back to 
  Future Missions you find the mission canceled (#222)<br/>
- Fixed a bug in the VAB/VIB: with some payloads, the color of the rocket/booster combination wasn't 
  changing to reflect whether it could lift the currently selected payload (#298)<br/>
   - This was noticed with an XMS-2 Lunar Pass using B/Titan and a B-Kicker.  When you 
     cycled to B/TITAN, the Current Payload displayed in dark red to show that a boosted Titan 
     couldn't lift that combo, but "B/TITAN" under Rocket still showed in white, sometimes leading 
     the player to purchase hardware that couldn't do the job.<br/>
- Fixed an array overflow error that used to occasionally crash toward the end of the game (#40, #200)<br/>
- Fixed a bug that caused the game to crash with a black screen, if the AI can't find an available crew 
  to send on the mission it's about to fly. This happened most often when it was flying direct ascent. (#552)
- When you're flying docking tests, the game used to get stuck sometimes at 2 DMs in your inventory. 
  For the rest of the game you always had two docking modules and didn't have to buy them again (#319)
  [not sure if this was in 1.1]<br/>
- An "A-OK" failure on an LEM Thrust Test (that is, one that let the test continue successfully) 
  used to not award you LM Point(s) for the test (#441)<br/>
- Certain mission launch steps involving a minishuttle defaulted to the capsule failure cases.<br/>
- The game used to allow you to assign Duration missions with an illegally low duration (#257, #278)<br/>
- Scrubbing a mission in the launch pad screen failed to free up any hardware you had purchased for 
  it (#292)<br/>
- If you had two missions ready to launch, and the first was successful and flown with hardware at Max
  Safety, if the second used the same hardware, that hardware would fly at above Max Safety (#614)
- When the capsule's emergency-eject system has to be used, the mission would often continue right 
  after, or say it was used successfully but all the crew shows as dead (#244)<br/>
- Fixed a  bug where a rocket suffers a major fire on the pad, destroying it; the crew survives, but 
  without any mention of the emergency-eject system being used (#547)
- The image for a damaged/destroyed Soviet launch pad instead showed a functioning pad with a rocket
  ready for launch. It now shows a damaged pad. The damaged-pad icon for the US wasn't too obviously 
  damaged either, so now it's more so. (#412) <br/>
- BARIS allowed you to use PgUp and PgDn to scroll through the newscast more efficiently, both at the 
  start of your turn and later in the Viewing Stand.  That functionality was lost in RIS because DOS 
  has a peculiar way of processing those keys, but it's now been restored - along with the Home and 
  End keys.<br/>
- Mission injuries that led to immediate retirement would retire someone without telling you. Now the 
  retirement is announced in the newscast. (#568)<br/>
- Resolved excessive astronaut/cosmonaut retirement checks to match original intent (#428)
- Resolved inconsistencies between the code and the comments when the game checks to see if people
  should retire.<br/>
- In recruitment, if you clicked and held on the up or down arrow, it would take 3 or 4 seconds 
  before the list would start to scroll.<br/>
- Addressed an oversight: in recruitment, if you dismissed a candidate, the number of available spots 
  didn't show any higher on the right. (#581)
- The number of spots to fill in recruitment now shows immediately instead of after you've selected 
  to recruit one.<br/>
- In recruitment, the Continue button didn't look quite right when clicked on (off by 1px).
- In Preferences, the Human/AI button nestled into the world map never looked quite right on the 
  Soviet side.  Now it does. (#353)<br/>
- There were two bugs that would cause the game to do a core dump and close if your LM made a fiery 
  impact on the lunar surface.  One of them has been fixed (#501)
- When a save is loaded in the Fall, the game would create an extra new intelligence briefing. This 
  could potentially have created an array overflow and overwriting of variables in games that were 
  saved multiple times (#217)<br/>
- If your lunar landing failed with the message "Maneuvering failure, craft lands in rough terrain causing damage", 
  the mission would go straight to Lunar Orbital Activities, skipping the liftoff (#505)
- On the lunar landing mission, the Photo Recon check was rolling against the Safety of the wrong device (#482)
- Director rankings were being calculated improperly (#580)
 
 
### GAME CHANGES

- Since the duration penalty system now works properly, we've made it possible to downgrade to a 
  lower Duration level in Mission Control (#255)<br/>
   - e.g., if you have a Duration C ready to go and schedule a Duration D for next turn, but 
     something goes wrong and the flight doesn't accomplish Duration C, next turn you can downgrade 
     the D mission to C to avoid the -5 penalty for skipping a level.<br/>
- We have added back Play By Email.  It worked in the CD version of BARIS, but was removed from RIS. 
  (#131) *[However, it has been disabled by default.]* <br/>
- If you have no missions planned for next turn when you hit the Flagpole, you now receive a warning 
  about it. (#166)<br/>
- When you open R&D, you will receive a warning if (#166):
   - You've prototyped an LM or Kicker-C but haven't started docking modules yet
   - You've prototyped a landing craft (LM, Kicker-C, direct ascent) but haven't started EVA suits yet
   - You've prototyped Gemini/Voskhod or a minishuttle, but haven't started a kicker yet<br/>
- If your cash is at or below 60MB and you have mission(s) scheduled for this turn but haven't assembled 
  them yet, opening R&D will now pop up a reminder to assemble the missions before spending your 
  money on research (#511)
- The VAB/VIB now has a Delay button to let you put a launch back a turn rather than having to scrub 
  it and reschedule. (#167)<br/>
- R&D and Purchasing can now by closed with the Esc key as well as Enter.
- In R&D and Purchasing, clicking on the image of the currently displayed hardware item will now pop 
  up a help message giving information about it (#467)<br/>
- Similarly, in Future Missions, the name box is now a button that brings up a description of the 
  currently selected mission. (#492)<br/>
- In Future Missions, the part of the screen that shows the safety risk is now a button that will 
  launch a pop-up breaking down your requirement penalty into milestone, duration, and 
  new mission penalties.  It also shows penalties on the LM steps of lunar landings. (#168, #373)<br/>
- In Future Missions, when you select crews, now skills are highlighted only when they'll be used on the 
  mission.  LM lights up only on missions that use a lunar module, for instance. 
   - In addition, LM Tests without EVA now highlight EV, but less brightly than other skills, because 
     an emergency EVA may be necessary if docking the LM back to the capsule fails.<br/>
- When you assign crews to a mission, their members' Endurance is now highlighted along with the skills 
  related to their roles in the crew - since Endurance now helps out on Duration missions.  They will not 
  highlight if use of endurance is turned off or game is set to Classic mode.  (#586) <br/>
- When you select a mission and are at the window to select the type of spacecraft, you can cancel out 
  of there by pressing Esc.  Previously you had to hit the Cancel button, but now you can do either. <br/>
- Mission Control now shows a figure for requirement penalties: the total of any milestone penalties, 
  duration penalties, and new mission penalty, if any (same as in Future Missions). This way, if say 
  your mission has a milestone or duration penalty you can see it there, and can try downgrading it 
  to remove the penalty. (#320)<br/>
- The line for requirement penalties is now color-coded green/yellow/red to match what Future Missions 
  would show in the A-OK!/CAUTION!/DANGER! section.<br/>
- Clicking on the image of the pad in Mission Control will now pop up a window that breaks down those 
  requirement penalties. (#168)<br/><br/>
- In the VAB/VIB, any hardware whose Safety is below Max R&D will now show in yellow, so you can go back 
  into R&D to research it more.  It was too easy to miss that before. (#166)
- The VAB/VIB also now shows the Safety of your EVA suits on missions that will use them, if they're 
  below Max R&D or have been damaged (#166) <br/>
- The last-minute launch confirmation screen now also shows hardware Safety percentages in yellow if 
  they're below Max R&D. (#166)
- Lots of improvements to the help file: grammar corrections, readability, more clarifications, 
  and in a few places updates to reflect additions we've made to the game.<br/>
- In single-player games, the Purchasing screen now includes a cheat: pressing $ will add 100MB to your 
  cash on hand.  This can be disabled in the config file, and is a Classic setting. (#597) <br/>
- When the AI wins the game, you now see its Moon landing play out like other prestige firsts.<br/>
- Increased height of Prestige First window so one more prestige first can be listed - which also 
  better centers the window on the screen.<br/>
- The game now distinguishes between a damaged and a destroyed pad. Previously, the Launch Facility 
  window showed "DESTROYED" while other windows showed it as "DAMAGED" - regardless what the game 
  had said happened to the pad. (#426)<br/>
- It also shows a different image for damaged versus destroyed launch pads. (#466)<br/>
- Damaged pads are always 10 or 15MB to repair. Destroyed pads cost 20 or 25MB to fix. (#412)<br/>
- The mission name on the pad is now moved slightly to the left - some mission types were crowding 
  the right margin (#270)
- The newscast, and the help pop-up when you press F1, now highlight the up and down arrows when 
  there is more text to scroll up or down to. (#372)<br/>
- The arrow keys in the Time Capsule also highlight if you can go up/down<br/>
- The arrow keys in the Library at the CIA/KGB also highlight if you can go up/down<br/>
- The R&D building now greys out research teams you can't afford.  Also, if you are within 5 points 
  of Max R&D, teams will be greyed out so you can't assign more teams than there are points of Safety 
  you can gain by research (#318)<br/>
- Saved games are now stored on disk with the name you give them, rather than as BUZZ1.SAV, BUZZ2.SAV, etc.
- In the Capsule Screen, crews assigned to a mission now show in a different color. Those assigned 
  to a mission for this turn show in blue, those for next turn in green; primary crews show in a 
  darker shade. And next to the capsule pic it says that they're Primary or Backup crew for this 
  turn or next. (#173)<br/>
- In the Capsule Screen, you can now bring up the Compatibility pop-up by clicking on the astronaut's
  name - you don't have to click exactly on the morale box.<br/>
- To keep track of how much time each person has spent in space, the game used to automatically 
  assign the maximum for each flight's duration level (A=2 days, B=5, C=7, D=12, E=16, F=20), rather 
  than choosing a number of days within each range.  As a result, your fellow on the suborbital (a 
  15-minute flight!) showed as having spent two days in space.  Now it assigns a number depending
  on the type of mission flown (or a random number of days in the range, for E & F). (#300)<br/>
- The game now makes some use of the Endurance skill (#384)
   - It contributes to the Duration steps of Duration flights
   - When the newscast randomly selects a spaceperson to be injured, the higher their Endurance
     the more likely they are to go to be injured rather than simply retire. <br/>
- When Mission Control recommends you scrub a mission, if you hit the button to do so, you're now prompted 
  for confirmation so you won't cancel it accidentally, plus it shows a bit more prominently so you're 
  less likely to miss it. (#475)
   - If you should opt to continue the mission, the hardware will suffer a temporary Safety penalty. 
     So this screen now mentions that fact above the button for scrubbing it. (#589)<br/>
- When you click on Recruitment and it asks to confirm whether to recruit spacepeople, the game now 
  shows how much money you have to help you decide whether to go ahead with it.
- You can now cancel out of astronaut/cosmonaut recruitment if you change your mind (#295)<br/>
- Similarly, the Esc key now cancels you out of the Time Capsule, same as pressing PLAY. <br/>
- In the Time Capsule, if you hit Save game but change your mind, pressing Esc will cancel the save (#620)
- Recruitment now shows more candidate skills. In addition to Capsule and Endurance, Docking also shows 
  at Astronaut Level 2, and at Level 1, all skills show. This can be returned to the way it used to be 
  in Advanced Preferences. (#176)
- There's now an option in Advanced Preferences that will let you recruit female 'nauts without having 
  to receive the newscast which requires you to recruit them (#329)<br/>
- Another option in Advanced Preferences is the Classic setting, which makes the game behave more like 
  it did in original BARIS: you're required to assign backup crews, etc.
- The Max R&D figures for Mercury and Gemini have been reset to their levels in the floppy version (#216)<br/>
- Player now has more mission downgrade options - in particular, it is now possible to downgrade a Lunar 
  Landing to a Lunar Orbital LM Test<br/>
- If you get the newscast saying you won't be able to purchase rockets for a year, or the equivalent one 
  for capsules, Future Missions will now warn you so you don't accidentally schedule missions you'd just have 
  to cancel next turn. (#611)
- Future Missions now shows the Duration Level (B-F) of manned missions above level A (#251)<br/>
- In Mission Control, your downgrade options now include an option to scrub the flight.<br/>
- If you scheduled an (Orbit) docking mission (which uses a DM left in orbit by a previous mission) 
  and the following turn there was no DM in orbit, the game was supposed to tell you that it was 
  downgrading the mission to remove the docking part, but that message didn't exist (#288)<br/>
- Any time you schedule an (Orbit) mission, Future Missions will now pop up a warning that you will 
  need to launch a DM this turn or next. (#451)<br/>
- The opening screen now defaults to the Historical Model rather than the Basic Model (#221)<br/>
- The country insignia at the start of a player's turn is now circular; it used to look oval, kind 
  of squashed (see #51)<br/>
- In R&D and Purchasing, the Atlas rocket now looks more like an Atlas rocket (#556) <br/>
- In R&D and Purchasing, the Soyuz capsule now looks a bit more like the real thing. <br/>
- The Boosted Atlas in the VAB looked short and fat, so it's been slimmed a bit. <br/>
- The Soyuz image in R&D and Purchasing now looks more like the real thing. <br/>
- The LK lander now looks more like the real thing, in R&D and Purchasing, the LM Program building, 
  the VIB, and the CIA/KGB report, though not in mission movies or the Step Failure screen (#588)
- Images of some rockets have had small improvements, both in the VAB/VIB and the intelligence screen: 
  in particular, the N1 looks more historical, the Saturn and Nova have better-looking fins, and the 
  Atlas doesn't look so phallic.<br/>
- In the VAB/VIB and the intelligence screen, the nozzles on Soviet rockets used to look a little ragged 
  or uneven - now they look a bit better.<br/>
- The VIB image for the Lapot shuttle was too long, causing an invisible error message (unless you 
  ran the program from the command prompt) saying it can't fit the lunar module - and sure enough, 
  you didn't see it on the righthand side in the VIB.  That's been fixed.  (#418)
- Question marks now look a little better (see middle of #207)<br/>
- In R&D, removed the percent sign from the RESEARCH STRONG: +1%/TEAM line, since the research news 
  events change the dice being rolled (7-sided instead of 6-sided, etc.) rather than rolling 6-sided 
  dice and then applying a plus or minus (#321)<br/>
- Small updates to the 'naut roster (removal of duplicates, etc.)<br/>
- Small updates to the endgame text to prevent text going off the righthand side<br/>
- Small updates to the newscast text (e.g., "cannot deliver any capsules or 4-person capsule/modules" 
  was confusing)<br/>
- The Soviet newscast now plays the Soviet newscast music (#214)<br/>
   - Starting with the CD version of BARIS, and in RIS through v.1.1, it played the US newscast music
   - The Soviet music improves the timing so that the movie's video better matches the voice of the 
     newscaster<br/>
- Mission Control and the Launch Facility screen used to play the music for the other side: Soviet 
  instead of US / US instead of Soviet (#258)
- Clarifications have been added to space tenure in 'naut History and to tenure in Basic and Advanced 
  Training: the number is now followed by "seasons" or "days" respectively (#300)<br/>
- The Saturn V has been renamed simply "Saturn" - to include other rockets in its family, such 
  as the Saturn IB (#216)<br/>
- The Soviet player's default name has been changed from KOROLOV to KOROLYOV, which is a closer
  transliteration (#262)<br/>
- In the VAB/VIB, if you hit Autopurchase but the rocket combo won't lift the current payload, the game 
  now warns you so you don't accidentally buy the wrong hardware. (#516)
- The VAB (but not the VIB) showed a weird stripe up the middle of the rocket fairing, which has been 
  removed. (#515)
- Some hardware (the US B-Kicker, the Lapot, and Soyuz) were showing odd black spots caused by transparency
  issues in the color palette (#513)
- In Future Missions, the cash figure is now centered under "CASH:"<br/>
- Better centering of program names containing "I" (Gemini, Jupiter) in Astronaut Complex / Cosmonaut 
  Center and Future Missions (#345, #361)<br/>
- Added Home and End key functionality to Basic and Advanced Training (#508)<br/>
- Added Home, End, PgUp, and PgDn functionality to the Prestige Summary and Mission Records screens 
  (#351)<br/>
- Added Home, End, PgUp, and PgDn functionality to the Help pop-up (#468)<br/>
- Added PgUp, PgDn, Home, and End key functionality in the recruitment screen - especially helpful when
  female candidates are available (#206)<br/>
- Added Home, End, PgUp, and PgDn functionality to the Time Capsule<br/>
- Added PgUp, PgDn, Home, and End key functionality to the CIA/KGB Library<br/>
- In recruitment, the Continue button is disabled until you've selected a full complement of 'nauts.
  Now it also pops up a message telling you so. (#462)<br/>
- In Hardware Efficiency (off the Museum), the flag in the top left has always been a hidden button 
  linking it to the Prestige Points screen (and vice versa).  The flag is now decorated and animated 
  as a button in those screens so as to stand out better.<br/>
- In Preferences, the movies/stills option has been disabled (#254)<br/>
- When you assign crews to a mission, if you don't have any available crews, the game still popped up 
  a message saying you don't have enough crews to assign a primary and a backup.  The old game used 
  to require a backup crew, and the message reflected that.  Now it will still show that message if
  you set the game to require backups, but if not it will say you don't have any crews 
  available. (#381)<br/>
- Credits now shows a screen for those who've worked on RIS, in addition to those who worked on the 
  original BARIS (#263)<br/>
- The Credits are now in a different color to be easier to read against the background (#211)<br/>
- Added names for people who were mentioned in a text file on the CD version but didn't actually 
  make it into the credits for that version<br/>
- The result text in the Step Failure screen ("Catastrophic Failure", "All Systems Are Go", etc.) is 
  now centered in its box.  It used to be left-justified.<br/>
- The Step Failure screen used to underline the crew member who failed a roll, which wasn't very 
  self-explanatory.  Now it shows their name in parentheses next to the dice roll results (#474)
- The Step Failure screen used to show the dice roll as Safety VS Roll (e.g., 85 VS 92), which seemed 
  backward. Now it shows Roll vs. Safety (e.g., 92 VS. 85).
- At the end of a single-player game, if you clicked on STATS, it showed your opponent's name as 
  COMPUTER# (e.g., COMPUTER2), the # representing which strategy the computer player used.  Now it 
  gives the name of the AI player and shows the number of its (randomly) chosen strategy. (#323)
- If any of the crew on the Moon landing is female, they now show in a different color 
  in the History section of the endgame.<br/>
- In the screen that asks who will be first on the Moon, the names have been centered in their
  respective buttons. Longer names were bleeding out past the edge of the button. (#535)
- People in Advanced Training now don't suffer the usual 4-point/turn loss of morale, since they're 
  presumably being groomed for something special (#279)
- In the Lunar Module screen, the square at the bottom showing TOTAL LM POINTS is now a button that 
  triggers a pop-up explaining the LM Point system (#506)
